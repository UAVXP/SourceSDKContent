# SourceSDKContent
Sources of maps, materials, models, and possibly code I've made to compile for Valve's Source engine. This is intended for archiving/historical, and educational purposes only. These are just source files and besides the maps, can be compiled for any engine.

I'm hoping in the future to get a server to host playable builds. If you like to help, please contact me (E-mail in profile) or you can help donate to my Pateron if you wish to help out me as a person in general.
